### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Version 0.0.5 ###

**Automatic Path Adjustment**

 Convert all absolute paths (`/images/photo.png`) and all root-relative paths (`images/photo.png`) of the document to paths that are relative to the current document. This means paths that work locally will work just as well when deployed.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Version 0.0.4 (MAJOR UPDATE) ###

[+] **Smart Format Completion**

 If you forget to specify a file extension (e.g., .png), don't worry! Our extension now cleverly adopts the format of the last used image.

[+] **Enhanced Context Menu**

Pre-filled 'default/before' option for the image src attribute right in the context menu, so you can say goodbye to staring at a blank input box.

[+] **Robust Error Handling**

Optimized code and more error handling.

[+] **Directory Path Support** 

 Want to save an image in a non-existent directory? No problem. Enter any path, and if the directory is missing, we'll prompt you with the option to create it on the fly.

[+] **Quick Access Shortcut**

Now you can use the shortcut `Shift + F2` to activate the extension's main functionality "Edit Image Path"

[+] **Undo Functionality**

Made a mistake? Take a step back with our new undo feature, giving you the safety net you need to edit paths confidently. Also you can use the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+Z`

### üî¢ Version 0.0.2 & 0.0.3 ###

Minor changes to extension overview, description, and GitHub Repository.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Version 0.0.1
